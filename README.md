# HAL-USB-Driver-Modifications
STM32 HAL USB Driver
Overview
This project provides a USB driver implementation using the STM32 Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). The driver facilitates communication between an STM32 microcontroller and a host system via the USB interface. It supports various USB classes and ensures reliable data transfer and device management.

Features
Supports USB 2.0 communication
Compatible with multiple USB classes (e.g., CDC, HID, MSC)
Full-speed USB operation
Implements control, bulk, interrupt, and isochronous transfer types
Easy integration with STM32CubeMX generated code
Configurable endpoint management
Error handling and recovery mechanisms
Lightweight and efficient design
Prerequisites
STM32 microcontroller (e.g., STM32F4, STM32F1, STM32L4 series)
STM32CubeMX (for code generation and configuration)
STM32 HAL library
Keil MDK, IAR Embedded Workbench, or STM32CubeIDE (for development)
Installation
Generate Code with STM32CubeMX:

Open STM32CubeMX and create a new project.
Select your STM32 microcontroller model.
Configure the USB peripheral (e.g., as Device Only).
Enable the desired USB class (e.g., CDC for virtual COM port).
Generate the initialization code.
Integrate the USB Driver:

Copy the generated USB-related files into your project directory.
Ensure the HAL library is included in your project.
Add the USB Driver Source Files:

Copy the provided USB driver source files (usb_driver.c, usb_driver.h) into your projectâ€™s source directory.
Include usb_driver.h in your main application file.
